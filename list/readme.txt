This project is an implementation of the std::list container of the c++ standard library. Container list is a doubly linked list which is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked elements. Each element contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and to the next element in the sequence of elements) and one data field.

The container list supports the following operations:
-get_size - returns the number of elements;
-is_empty - indicates whether the list is empty or not;
-front - returns a reference to the first element;;
-back ÖŠ returns a reference to the last element;
-push_front - inserts a new element at the beginning of the list;
-push_back - inserts a new element at the end of the list;
-pop_front - removes the first element of the list;
-pop_back - removes the last element of the list.

To compile and run the program, you need to enter the command "make" in the terminal. Use the command "make clean" to remove the intermediate files and the executable file "stack" created as a result of program compilation.
